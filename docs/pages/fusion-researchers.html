<p><a href="https://www.universityofgalway.ie/our-research/people/davidstyles/">David Styles' profile</a></p>
<p>David Styles is an associate professor in Agricultural Sustainability at the University of Galway and an adjunct senior lecturer in Environmental Engineering at the University of Limerick. He specializes in environmental foot-printing and techno-economic assessment of product systems, with over 18 years of experience in life cycle assessment (LCA). David has worked at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland's Environmental Protection Agency, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Bangor University, and the Universities of Limerick and Galway. His research group applies advanced LCA to investigate the sustainability of circular and bio-based value chains, focusing on understanding inter-system effects and cascading flows of materials and energy. David is a member of the International Energy Agency Task 45 on the sustainability of bioenergy, the carbon budget committee of Ireland's Climate Change Advisory Council, and the expert advisory group of Ireland's National Bioeconomy Forum. He is currently project coordinator or work package leader across 10 national and European research projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colm-duffy-06b99371/">Colm Duffy's profile</a></p>
<p>Colm is an EPA fellow working on the EIR-FLUX project, which aims to identify a broad range of appropriate mitigation options at the catchment level. Colm is doing this utilising the GOBLIN framework. Colm was also the lead developer on the SeQUEsTER project, meaning that his experience in relation to the GOBLIN model is unparalleled given his engineering/pioneering work on the modelling framework. Colm also holds a PhD on Climate Smart Agriculture from the University of Galway (UoG), as well as a MSc in Climate Smart Agriculture and Food Security. Further, Colm obtained a BSc in International Development and Food Policy from University College Cork (UCC). Lastly, Colm hold two diplomas in International Development (UCC) and Software Engineering (UoG). Colm has experience in LCA modelling, both attributional and consequential, and has combined this work with several biophysical models. Colm’s work is supported by an impressive publication record in internationally noted journals. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ichec.ie/staff/alastair-mckinstry/">Alastair McKinstry's profile</a></p>
<p>Alastair McKinstry is Environmental Program manager at the Irish Centre for High-End Computing, where he works on code optimisation of weather and climate software and Earth system modelling.  His background is in High-performance code optimisation and data, working in industry in the HPTC group in Digital/Compaq, as Principal Engineer in Oracle before moving to ICHEC. He has worked as work package lead in multiple PRACE and H2020 projects including ESCAPE, ESiWACE and ESiWACE2 on adaptation of weather and climate codes to petascale and then Exascale, and as PI on ESA and Copernicus projects for Earth observation and climate data.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ul.ie/research/dr-kenneth-byrne">Ken Byrne's profile</a></p>
<p>Ken Byrne has 30 years research experience on the effect of land use on soil carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions. He has particular expertise in greenhouse gas exchange and carbon stocks in forest and peatland ecosystems. He has also worked on carbon storage in wood products and timber use for construction. Internationally he has contributed to the development of carbon emission factors for peat soils through his Lead Authorship of three IPCC reports (2004 Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF 2004, 2006 Guidelines for AFOLU and 2013 Wetlands Supplement) and was a member of the IPCC team awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. In addition he was a Lead Author of both the Thematic Assessment on Land Degradation and Restoration and the Europe and Central Asia Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. He is a member of the editorial boards of PLOS Climate and Frontiers in Forests and Global Change.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-h-69399a174/">Daniel Henn's profile</a></p>
<p>Daniel is a PhD candidate on the LoCAM (Lowering the carbon and ammonia footprints of pasture-based dairy production) project and is based at University of Limerick’s Bernal Institute. As part of LoCAM, he has contributed to the continuous improvement of the GOBLIN model, particularly the bio-physical representation of livestock and grasslands for the development of pathways towards climate neutrality from the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. His research interests include land use modelling, climate and environmental impact assessment, sustainable agriculture and life-cycle assessment (LCA). Prior to his PhD candidature, Daniel received a M.Sc. degree in Environmental Science after graduating from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Uppsala. He also worked as a research assistant in SLU’s Department of Soil and Environment to develop strategies for greenhouse gas accounting of land use changes, particularly forests, on a municipal level in Sweden.</p>
