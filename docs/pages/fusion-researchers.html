<p>Dr. George Bishop is an environmental scientist at the University of Galway. His primary research pursuits revolve around using forward-looking life cycle assessment (LCA) to explore and understand the complex systems transformation necessary to achieve "Net Zero" and Bioeconomy ambitions. His past work has evaluated the environmental sustainability of various bio-based systems, including bioproducts, livestock, national AFOLU, and waste management systems.  George is an LCA analyst on the DAFM funded project: <a href="https://informbioproject.ie/">INFORMBIO</a> (Integrated Framework for Mapping, Modelling and Monitoring Ireland's Bioeconomy) which aims to develop a low carbon roadmap for Ireland's bioeconomy. <a href="https://informbioproject.ie/">INFORMBIO</a> will develop a first Foresight Analysis for Ireland's bioeconomy, attempting to quantify the potential of the bioeconomy to contribute to Ireland's climate and sustainability targets. Moreover, the project positions Ireland as a front-runner among EU member states, by developing a prototype national bioeconomy monitoring system, enabling stakeholders to track the development and progress of the national bioeconomy against key bioeconomy indicators.</p>

<p>Emma is a PhD Walsh Scholar at Teagasc and the University of Galway currently working on reducing GHGâ€™s and ammonia emissions for dairy production systems at Solohead Research Farm under the supervision of Dr James Humphreys (Teagasc) and Dr David Styles (UoG). 
Emma's research is focused on developing a blueprint for low or zero artificial fertilizer Nitrogen (AFN) use for low emissions pasture based dairy farming that delivers a competitive economic return to dairy farmers. A key element of study is the quantifaction of the impact of implementing the blueprint on 30 conventional dairy farms. Using the profit monitor, Pasturebase and other data sources the impact of the blueprint will be determined in terms of the carbon and ammonia footprints and economic competitiveness. Emma also aims to examine the impacts of AFN and high and low winter pasture covers on the long-term productivity and economic competitiveness of WC-BFN-based grassland, this work will be carried out at Solohead Research Farm.</p>
